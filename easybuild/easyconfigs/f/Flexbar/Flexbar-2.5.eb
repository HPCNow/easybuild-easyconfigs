It demultiplexes barcoded runs and removes adapter sequences. Moreover, trimming and 
filtering features are provided. Flexbar increases read mapping rates and improves 
genome and transcriptome assemblies. It supports next-generation sequencing data in 
fasta/q and csfasta/q format from Illumina, Roche 454, and the SOLiD platform."""
